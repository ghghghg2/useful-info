<div class="entry-content"><p>There are many types of memory reordering, and not all types of reordering occur equally often. It all depends on processor you&rsquo;re targeting and/or the toolchain you&rsquo;re using for development.</p>

<p>A <strong>memory model</strong> tells you, for a given processor or toolchain, exactly what types of memory reordering to expect at runtime relative to a given source code listing. Keep in mind that the effects of memory reordering can only be observed when <a href="http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming">lock-free programming</a> techniques are used.</p>

<p>After studying memory models for a while &ndash; mostly by reading various online sources and verifying through experimentation &ndash; I&rsquo;ve gone ahead and organized them into the following four categories. Below, each memory model makes all the guarantees of the ones to the left, plus some additional ones. I&rsquo;ve drawn a clear line between weak memory models and strong ones, to capture the way most people appear to use these terms. Read on for my justification for doing so.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/weak-strong-table.png" /></p>

<p>Each physical device pictured above represents a <strong>hardware</strong> memory model. A hardware memory model tells you what kind of memory ordering to expect at runtime relative to an <em>assembly</em> (or machine) code listing.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/hardware-matters.png" /></p>

<p>Every processor family has different habits when it comes to memory reordering, and those habits can only be observed in multicore or multiprocessor configurations. Given that <a href="http://preshing.com/20120208/a-look-back-at-single-threaded-cpu-performance">multicore is now mainstream</a>, it&rsquo;s worth having some familiarity with them.</p>

<p>There are <strong>software</strong> memory models as well. Technically, once you&rsquo;ve written (and debugged) portable lock-free code in C11, C++11 or Java, only the software memory model is supposed to matter. Nonetheless, a general understanding of hardware memory models may come in handy. It can help you explain unexpected behavior while debugging, and — perhaps just as importantly — appreciate how incorrect code may function correctly on a specific processor and toolchain out of luck.</p>

<h2 id="weak-memory-models">Weak Memory Models</h2>

<p><a href="http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations"><img class="right" src="/images/analogy-small.png" /></a>In the weakest memory model, it&rsquo;s possible to experience <a href="http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations">all four types of memory reordering</a> I described using a source control analogy in a previous post. Any load or store operation can effectively be reordered with any other load or store operation, as long as it would never modify the behavior of a single, isolated thread. In reality, the reordering may be due to either <a href="http://preshing.com/20120625/memory-ordering-at-compile-time">compiler reordering</a> of instructions, or memory reordering on the processor itself.</p>

<p>When a processor has a weak hardware memory model, we tend to say it&rsquo;s <em>weakly-ordered</em> or that it has <em>weak ordering</em>. We may also say it has a <em>relaxed</em> memory model. The venerable <strong>DEC Alpha</strong> is everybody&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt#2277">favorite example</a> of a weakly-ordered processor. There&rsquo;s really no mainstream processor with weaker ordering.</p>

<p>The C11 and C++11 programming languages expose a weak software memory model which was in many ways influenced by the Alpha. When using low-level atomic operations in these languages, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re actually targeting a strong processor family such as x86/64. As I demonstrated previously, you must still specify the <a href="http://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics">correct memory ordering constraints</a>, if only to prevent compiler reordering.</p>

<h3 id="weak-with-data-dependency-ordering">Weak With Data Dependency Ordering</h3>

<p>Though the Alpha has become less relevant with time, we still have several modern CPU families which carry on in the same tradition of weak hardware ordering:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ARM</strong>, which is currently found in hundreds of millions of smartphones and tablets, and is increasingly popular in multicore configurations.</li>
  <li><strong>PowerPC</strong>, which the Xbox 360 in particular has already delivered to 70 million living rooms in a multicore configuration.</li>
  <li><strong>Itanium</strong>, which Microsoft no longer supports in Windows, but which is still supported in Linux and found in HP servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>These families have memory models which are, in various ways, almost as weak as the Alpha&rsquo;s, except for one common detail of particular interest to programmers: they maintain <a href="http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/memory-barriers.txt#305">data dependency ordering</a>. What does that mean? It means that if you write <code>A-&gt;B</code> in C/C++, you are always guaranteed to load a value of <code>B</code> which is at least as new as the value of <code>A</code>. The Alpha doesn&rsquo;t guarantee that. I won&rsquo;t dwell on data dependency ordering too much here, except to mention that the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/262464/">Linux RCU mechanism</a> relies on it heavily.</p>

<h2 id="strong-memory-models">Strong Memory Models</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s look at hardware memory models first. What, exactly, is the difference between a strong one and a weak one? There is actually <a href="http://herbsutter.com/2012/08/02/strong-and-weak-hardware-memory-models/#comment-5903">a little disagreement</a> over this question, but my feeling is that in 80% of the cases, most people mean the same thing. Therefore, I&rsquo;d like to propose the following definition:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>A <strong>strong hardware memory model</strong> is one in which every machine instruction comes implicitly with <a href="http://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics">acquire and release semantics</a>. As a result, when one CPU core performs a sequence of writes, every other CPU core sees those values change in the same order that they were written.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&rsquo;s not too hard to visualize. Just imagine a refinement of the <a href="http://preshing.com/20120710/memory-barriers-are-like-source-control-operations">source control analogy</a> where all modifications are committed to shared memory in-order (no StoreStore reordering), pulled from shared memory in-order (no LoadLoad reordering), and instructions are always executed in-order (no LoadStore reordering). StoreLoad reordering, however, <a href="http://preshing.com/20120515/memory-reordering-caught-in-the-act">still remains possible</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/strong-hardware.png" /></p>

<p>Under the above definition, the <strong>x86/64</strong> family of processors is <em>usually</em> strongly-ordered. There are certain cases in which some of x86/64&rsquo;s <a href="http://preshing.com/20120913/acquire-and-release-semantics#comment-20810">strong ordering guarantees are lost</a>, but for the most part, as application programmers, we can ignore those cases. It&rsquo;s true that a x86/64 processor can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-order_execution">execute instructions out-of-order</a>, but that&rsquo;s a hardware implementation detail &ndash; what matters is that it still keeps its <em>memory interactions</em> in-order, so in a multicore environment, we can still consider it strongly-ordered. Historically, there has also been a little confusion due to <a href="http://jakob.engbloms.se/archives/1435">evolving specs</a>. </p>

<p>Apparently <strong>SPARC</strong> processors, when running in <strong>TSO</strong> mode, are another example of a strong hardware ordering. TSO stands for &ldquo;total store order&rdquo;, which in a subtle way, is different from the definition I gave above. It means that there is always a single, global order of writes to shared memory from all cores. The x86/64 has this property too: See Volume 3, §8.2.3.6-8 of <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html">Intel&rsquo;s x86/64 Architecture Specification</a> for some examples. From what I can tell, the TSO property isn&rsquo;t usually of direct interest to low-level lock-free programmers, but it is a step towards sequential consistency.</p>

<h3 id="sequential-consistency">Sequential Consistency</h3>

<p>In a <a href="http://preshing.com/20120612/an-introduction-to-lock-free-programming#sequential-consistency">sequentially consistent</a> memory model, there is no memory reordering. It&rsquo;s as if the entire program execution is reduced to a sequential interleaving of instructions from each thread. In particular, the result r1 = r2 = 0 from <a href="http://preshing.com/20120515/memory-reordering-caught-in-the-act">Memory Reordering Caught in the Act</a> becomes impossible.</p>

<p>These days, you won&rsquo;t easily find a modern multicore device which guarantees sequential consistency at the hardware level. However, it seems at least one sequentially consistent, dual-processor machine existed back in 1989: The 386-based <a href="http://vogons.zetafleet.com/viewtopic.php?t=23842#178666">Compaq SystemPro</a>. According to Intel&rsquo;s docs, the 386 wasn&rsquo;t advanced enough to perform any memory reordering at runtime.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123973376/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=preshonprogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0123973376"><img class="right" src="/images/art-of-multiprocessor.png" /></a>In any case, sequential consistency only really becomes interesting as a <strong>software</strong> memory model, when working in higher-level programming languages. In Java 5 and higher, you can declare shared variables as <code>volatile</code>. In C++11, you can use the default ordering constraint, <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, when performing operations on atomic library types. If you do those things, the toolchain will restrict compiler reordering and emit CPU-specific instructions which act as the appropriate memory barrier types. In this way, a sequentially consistent memory model can be &ldquo;emulated&rdquo; even on weakly-ordered multicore devices. If you read Herlihy &amp; Shavit&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0123973376/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=preshonprogr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0123973376">The Art of Multiprocessor Programming</a>, be aware that most of their examples assume a sequentially consistent software memory model.</p>

<h2 id="further-details">Further Details</h2>

<p>There are many other subtle details filling out the spectrum of memory models, but in my experience, they haven&rsquo;t proved quite as interesting when writing lock-free code at the application level. There are things like control dependencies, causal consistency, and different memory types. Still, most discussions come back the four main categories I&rsquo;ve outlined here.</p>

<p>If you really want to nitpick the fine details of processor memory models, and you enjoy eating formal logic for breakfast, you can check out the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/weakmemory/">admirably detailed work</a> done at the University of Cambridge. Paul McKenney has written an <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/470681/">accessible overview</a> of some of their work and its associated tools.</p>
